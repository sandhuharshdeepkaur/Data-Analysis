**What is Data-Analysis?**


Data analysis is the science of examining a set of data to draw conclusions about the information to be able to make decisions or simply to expand the knowledge on various subjects.

It consists of subjecting data to operations. This is done to obtain precise conclusions that will help us achieve our objectives, such as operations that cannot be previously defined since data collection may reveal specific difficulties.

Currently, many industries use data to draw conclusions and decide on actions to implement. It is worth mentioning that science also uses data analysis to test or discard existing theories or models.

Daniel Burrus, business consultant and speaker on business and innovation issues, says in reference to data analysis: “A lot of this will help humans work smarter and faster because we have data on everything that happens”.
